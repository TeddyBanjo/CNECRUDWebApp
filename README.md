Project Title- CNE CRUD Web Application

As part of the QA course we were assigned a project to build. This was an individual project which we were instructed to build a CRUD application which encoparted tools and shared knowledge during the first few week of the training. 

I decided to make my project based around one of my favorite interests movies. The applicaition would take input from the user on a web page which would then get pushed to a REST API which will allow the data to be stored in a database. 

Technology Used Includes: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP , JAVA, SPRINGBOOT, POSTMAN.
